"""
Bio Inspired Navigation  Reproducible Data Generator (Data S1)

This project contains the complete codebase to reproducibly generate all datasets and key figures for the supplemental file `Data S1`.

Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a transparent and robust method for recreating the core experimental data presented in the paper. It generates three primary datasets and two corresponding visualizations.

Features

- Sophisticated Data Simulation: Trajectory data includes a periodic error correction model to more accurately simulate the proposed framework.
- High-Quality Plot Generation: Automatically creates PNG files for Figure 13 (Localization Accuracy) and Figure 15B (Energy Consumption).
- Structured Codebase: Organized as a proper Python package for clarity and maintainability.
- Command-Line Interface: Provides flexible control over data and plot generation.
- Clean Data Ouput: All data is saved in the standard, easy-to-use CSV format.

How to Use

Prerequisites

You must have Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them via pip:
