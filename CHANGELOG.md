## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

The new version introduces significant architectural changes. Here's how to migrate:

#### Old Usage (v1.0.0)
```python
# Old monolithic approach
exec(open('main.py').read())
```

#### New Usage (v2.0.0)
```python
# New modular approach
from bio_nav_data import BioNavDataGenerator

generator = BioNavDataGenerator()
generator.run_complete_pipeline()
```

#### Command Line
```bash
# Old: No command line interface
python main.py

# New: Rich command line interface
python main.py --config-only
python main.py --validate
python main.py --log-level DEBUG
```

### Breaking Changes
- Package structure completely reorganized
- All imports now use the `bio_nav_data` package
- Configuration is now centralized and validated
- Logging is mandatory and configurable
- File paths are now managed by the Config class

### New Features
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Professional logging system
- Modular, testable code structure
- Command-line interface
- Automated testing and CI/CD
- Professional documentation
